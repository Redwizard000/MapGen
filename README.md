# MapGen

This program is a re-write of code I found here: https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/procedurally-generating-wrapping-world-maps-in-unity-c-part-1

The orignial code is written for unity, I am re-writing the class so that it can be used in any generic C# WPF program without needing to load the Unity engine.
